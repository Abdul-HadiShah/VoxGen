Introduction
VoxGen is an innovative AI-driven platform designed to provide accessible and affordable speech therapy for children with Down syndrome. Addressing the global shortage of speech-language pathologists (SLPs), particularly in regions like Pakistan, VoxGen offers a scalable, home-based solution. The project was developed for the TEKNOFEST competition in the "Technology for Humanity, Healthcare" category.

The platform is available as both a mobile and web application, making it easily accessible for families and caregivers. It uses cutting-edge AI to personalize therapy sessions and provide real-time feedback, ultimately improving a child's speech, articulation, and prosody in an engaging way.

Features
Personalized AI Coach: Our core feature is an AI-powered coach that provides real-time, adaptive feedback tailored to the child's specific needs. The coach helps with pronunciation accuracy, rhythm, and tone, making therapy sessions more effective.

Gamified Learning: To keep children engaged and motivated, VoxGen incorporates interactive and multisensory exercises presented in a fun, game-like format.

Progress Tracking Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard allows parents and caregivers to monitor a child's progress over time. It displays key metrics such as pronunciation accuracy, engagement levels, and overall improvement.

Localized Solution: The platform aims to bridge the therapy gap in underserved areas. While the current version is in English, future plans include expanding support to local languages like Urdu, Sindhi, and Punjabi.
